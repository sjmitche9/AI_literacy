    "### AI Literacy Exercise 1: APIs in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is your first AI Literacy exercise, it warrants a little explanation.  We can use AI to help us learn.  This isn't limited to learning how to code, but we can certainly make use of AI here.  We can use AI to help us understand Data Science concepts and potentially identify problems with our computers.  There's a lot of hype around using AI to generate code.  This can be a great tool, but must be approached with caution.  Approach AI tools with a \"learning first\" attitude.  These tools can help you learn, understand and ultimately generate code faster, but make sure that you understand everything that it gives you. Break your problem down into the smallest pieces that you can, and ask specific questions.  If you don't understand something, make this apparent to the AI.  If you use AI to generate very large blocks or entire assignments of code, not only will it be very obvious, but your coding won't improve, and you may need to code live at some point for a job interview.\n",
